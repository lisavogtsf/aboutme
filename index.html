		<p>Hello, General Assembly Admissions people! My name is Lisa, which rhymes with "Pisa" when you say it out loud.  I feel like I covered pretty much all of the bases in my application, but here's a little bit more about me.</p>
		<p>Currently I run my own small business tutoring beginning computer users and supporting some more advanced ones. I am a San Francisco native, although technically I was born in Brazil. My undergraduate History of Science degree is from Harvard, and my masters in Women and Gender Studies is from San Francisco State University. While I had two stints as a professional web developer in the past, recently my interest in coding has been rekindled by seeing friends break into the tech industry and by getting a taste of contemporary web development myself. 
		</p>
		<p>I am excited about the General Assembly Web Development Immersive because I am ready to accelerate my studies, collaborate with others and challenge myself.</p>
		<p>I initially made a 3-page site, so to condense it I have made this page quite long, but with anchor links so you can navigate within it. The <a href="#portfolio">Portfolio</a> page has examples of two web pages I have made, and the <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a> page offers numerous ways to get in touch with me.
	</article>
<a id="portfolio">Portfolio</a>
Add portfolio section here--two images with brief captions and links
<br>
<a id="contact">Contact</a>
Add contact information here.  Maybe in columns to condense?
